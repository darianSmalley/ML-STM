# ML-STM
Atomic scale defect detection and analysis in scanning tunneling microscope images of single crystal tungsten diselenide via an ensemble of U-Net convolutional neural networks and unsupervised fuzzy clustering.

## Links to Training Dataset
The following google drive link will download a zip file which contains all of the data. The "./datastores/WSe2" folder in this GitHub repo should be *replaced* with the extracted folder from Google Drive.

The following zenodo DOI is still under rewivew but will be the preferred means of downloading the dataset in the future. The files in this repo should be extracted stright into the existing './datastores/WSe2' folder, but NOT replace it.
